And the clouds will part here

I can saw a woman in two
But you won't want to look in the box when I do
I can make love disappear
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer

I can pull a rabbit out of a hat
I can pull it out but I can't put it back
I can make love disappear
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer

It's lonely up here
When the tricks have been played
And the spotlights have faded
And the plans that we made
Have fallen apart
It's lonely as hell
And there's no magic spell
For a broken heart

You can put me in chains and I will escape
Better not wait up 'cause I might be late
I can make love disappear
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer

And the spotlights have faded
And the plans that we made

The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

CHORUS
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Noone over here reads the papers pal
'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song

CHORUS

Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
""That's a mighty big word for a nine year old""

You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll",en

Don't bring the milk in
Leave it on the porch
Don't read the papers
Don't mow the lawn no more
Drive to the market
At the break of dawn
Watch 'em unload the produce
Then ride right back home

It's the white man's burden
And it weighs a ton
I'm a family man
Model citizen

Torment the mailman
Terrorize the maid
Try to teach 'em some manners
Whip 'em into shape
Down in the basement
I've got a Craftsman lathe
Show it to the children
When they misbehave

It's the white man's burden
And it weighs a ton
I'm a family man
Model citizen

I'm a law-abiding man
I'm a good Samaritan
I pay my taxes when I can
Model citizen

In the cool of the evening
When the sun goes down
My wife's playing canasta
With everyone in town

When I feel the pressure
And I need a break
Load up the Winnebago
Drive it in the lake

It's the white man's burden
And it weighs a ton

cream cone
My ma's in the back seat sittin' all alone
As my pa steers her slow out of the lot
For a test drive down Michigan Avenue

Now, my ma, she fingers her wedding band
And watches the salesman stare at my old

give us
If he could, but he just can't

Well if I could, I swear I know just what

I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car

Now, the neighbors come from near and far
As we pull up in our brandnew used car
I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out
a cry
Tell `em all they can kiss our asses
goodbye

My dad, he sweats the same job from
mornin' to morn
Me, I walk home on the same dirty streets
where I was born
Up the block I can hear my little sister
In the front seat blowin' that horn

Going to stay here in my place, and you'll stay in yours
Because you're only good as what you're good for

Waiting while the burning pictures fade

And another to say its name

That maybe things could be different now

Could going through the motions lead to real emotion?

Interview:
What did you do in the services?
What did I do in the services? I was a fighter pilot. Yeah, that's right. But they didn't like me. They didn't want me. When I was sent overseas, the first thing they told me was: ""um, we can't use you because we didn't send for you""
I was trained. The government paid, the government spent over $250,000 to train me as a pilot, and then after I got overseas, a general sent his adjutant down to meet our group to say that we didn't send for you and we don't want you. That's right. This is the truth, I'm telling you the truth! This is straight life but, ah, somehow we go onâ€¦ We go on because we would like to think there's hope. But that's a lie, there ain't no hope and that's the truth, that's the truth baby!
That's right when I know you out of the box. (laughter) Yeah, that's right! You know the town that I was born in, we didn't have no streets? It was all dirt roads, dirt roads and poor people, nobody had nothing. Matter of fact, we used to get together to have community meals. Somebody had cabbage, somebody else had some meat, somebody else had some corn mean and we'd get together and we'd make a meal, have a community dinner. That was when we were lucky and then we'd play cards. We didn't have any signals 'cause we didn't need any. Nobody had any cars. That's right! And on the corner, on particular corners, there were accidents all the time. Most of the people who were hurt in the accidents died just because nobody came to pick them up. The ambulance never came. That's right, the ambulance never came. I've just seen many a man bleed to death, lying on the streetâ€¦
There's got to be a change, there's got to be a change and there's enough people to do it! If they would get off their big fat you-know-what, and move! Because we don't have much time. There's enough people sayin', ""Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame?"" Standing around. Good people, oh yeah! They all regard themselves as good people and they are full of ""ain't it a shame's"". And why don't people, why can't they see and why don't everybody do this and why don't everybody do that?
But if they, it's time for them to make a move, gets hands outta your pockets and go to work. Do something! Otherwise there gonna be nothing to do (laughter) Yeah, and that's funny!

They're afraid to raise the flag 'less it gets torn to shreds
But God forbid the wind should ever stop blowin'

I'm sure we'd all fall down
But sometimes it isn't windy
Like last February
I remember it snowed
and a week later it hailed
And now it looks like raining
Now it looks like raining
I'm convinced that what makes the rain and hail so heavy over here
is that the sherrif has been messing with out minds.
handin' out questionnaries to the pris'ners who are blind
to the pris'ners who are blind
Let me tell you one thing new at the county farm
They've got muzak in the fields
which makes this life of mine a little more unreal
a little more unreal
But I wish they'd kill the sounds, I wish they'd kill the sounds
You don't knowwhat it's like to hear Debussy in a California prison field
And I love
I love to sing while I'm workin'
I love to sing while I'm workin'
And the wind has been blowin'
And the wind has been blowin'

I've given up reading for a time and taken up other pastimes
Such as watchin' winos gum their food and epileptics havin' bad times
More frequently I've been lost in this game
And it looks like they're gonna make a crim'nal out of me
A criminal out of me
But those guys who are down on me winnin'
Lord knows, they take the game so seriously
But what hurts me more, burts me more than anything
Is when I get your mail
When I get your mail, they've cut you
They've cut out the parts and the words that have feeling
So I'm left with only part of you
I say I'm only left with part of you
And the wind has been blowin'
And the wind has been blowin'

Oh, play your guitar, baby
Play your guitar, baby,
Get me off this farm, baby, take me away...

And apart from all this crap there is some peace and quiet
Except for the screws grumbling and mumbling and calling me a long hair
I wouldn't mind, but they cut my hair quite some time ago
They cut it off when I first came here
Which tells me Indo-China is really here behind this wire
And it soon will be dying engulfed in their own fire, in their own fire
In fact, they tell me that a boy like me shouldn't think like that
But this is murder and everybody accepts that.
Lord knows, they all accept it, and everybody knows thatt ain't where its at
So take care, pray for rain and maybe I'll see you
Visiting hours next week
And when the screw, when the screw says no touching,
Lord knows, I'll turn the other cheek.

Hardly a single day goes by

When I do it's nothing and nobody's there to listen anyway

I just listen to the voices on the TV 'til I'm tired
My eyes grow heavy and I fade away

A spineless irritation from some time before
When more than life was cursin' through my veins.

Laughing as you lay upon our bed of bloody love â€” and left me.
Think about me, drink about me, I don't care,

If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.

Across the street they're eating now and holding hands,
An image of a priest with bibles lain across his hands for me.

So come on babe, your time is drawing near.

An empty picture frame upon a dirty window sill .

Shattered by a lying snake like you.

The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

I hold a mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
A passion that breaks reason in two

I - I - I have to think and - I have to think and stop me now
If reminices make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality

I wonder who started all this
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away?

Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees - who made the sky
Who made the storms - who made heartbreak?
I wonder how much life I can take

I see at last a future self
Were you alive I'd ask your help
But thinking puts me in a daze
And thinking never helped me anyway

You always were so negative
You never saw the positive
You always stand upon the edge
And dream of what it must be to be dead

I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body - and be free

You'd like to float like a mystic child
You'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
You'd love to solve the mistery of live
By cutting someone's throat or removing their heart
You'd like to see it beat
You'd like to hold your eyes
And though you know I'm dead
You'd like to hold my thighs

If it's wrong to think on this
To hold the dead past - to hold the dead past in your fist
Why were we - why were we given memories?
Let's lose our mids
Be set free!

Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by

I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

I wonder
I wonder who started all this - ooh

The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion.
Seagulls fly across my mind forever.
Sadly goes the wind on its way to Hades.
Would I, should I, could I be a stranger ?
I shall walk right by and sigh good-bye.

On the gallows for me

They chase him through the alleys
Chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest

First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan
While they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so

Maybe I would, too

And you always show up late

I don’t need shoes to follow
Bare feet running with you
Somewhere the rainbow ends my dear

Don’t you think we need a new referee
I can’t let the ball drop
Boy I need some interference to shut them up

Oh take me with you
I don’t need shoes to follow
Bare feet running with you
Somewhere the rainbow ends my dear

Oh take me with you
Chase rabbits into their burrow
Bare feet running with you
Today even the rain can cut me up

Tears turn to steal and the wound never heals
in the darkness of November
Well the witch is in the tower
And the snake’s in the bower
And the hunt goes on forever
Now the stake is there to burn
My fathers robe is torn between cross and Mother
With the blood on your hands come on
What you doin’
I am fed up with this questioning.

Oh take me with you
I don’t need shoes to follow
Bare feet running with you
Somewhere the rainbow ends my dear

Oh take me with you
Chase rabbits into their burrow
Bare feet running with you today today

Oh take me with you
I don’t need shoes to follow
Bare feet running with you
Today even the rain
Even the rain
Even the rain
Can cut me up

We cannot win the day

By our so-called friends
Not the friends we should have made

To write another scene
Because you're the one
Who taught me to believe
There is something more
That I need to say
I should've said it though
I should've said it though
Before yesterday
Before your breakaway

This jungle is dark
But full of diamonds
That can cut and exploit
With just a whiff of blood
Faith in spades in us
So what were the odds?
Our hand of hearts would have to fold
To their flush of clubs

You've been betrayed
I've been played
At least they made me exit
Through their chopper on the stage

Drove a chopped up Challenger
down Route 9
Through the dead ends and all the bad scenes
And when the promise was broken
I cashed in a few of my dream

Well, I built that Challenger by myself
But I needed money and so I sold it
I lived a secret I should've kept to myself

All my life I fought that fight
The one that no man can never win
And every day it just gets harder

I stay up every morning until it turns light
Thunder Road ...
There's something dying out on the highway tonight

Well now I won big once and I hit the coast,
Oh but somehow I paid the big cost

The broken spirits of all the other ones who lost

Like when the truth is spoken, it don't make no
difference
Finally something in your heart turns cold

two-bit bars

But sanctuary never comes
Without some kind of risk
Illusions without freedom

Never quite add up to bliss
The haunting and the haunted
Play a game no one can win

And by dawn they're gone again

To ride that ever changing wave
That never seems to crest

To shiver in the darkest night
Afraid to make a stand

Made more plans than anyone who ever paid their rent.
I'm not stupid and I might be havin' too much pride.
Surgeon general has determined that I may as well die.


Jesus are you watching or have you gone blind.
Evil souls are upon us and we're surely runnin' out of time.


CHORUS
I tried religion and some holy roller steals my tenth.
In the grave yard I ain't strong enough to jump the fence.
Some men they say they got more soul than both my shoes.
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.


I might be workin' on a scene that I can never act.
Everybody's gonna think that my mind is cracked.
I don't care because it's my right to win or lose.
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.


Crazy, am I crazy for wanting so much more.
My mind says I can't ever give up but I still can't be sure.

Can we ever stop payin' dues.
Can we ever stop payin' dues.
Can we ever stop payin' dues.

With her lips so fine
And her shoulders go weak
As she closes her eyes

See how she moves through the door
How she loses her keys
How she loses her cool
Watching blackbirds scatter through the trees
How she flips from the back to the front
Reading magazines
Oh, my God, I miss those things
And it's a hard way to fall
And this ain't the easy way down
And it's a hard thing to love anyone, anyhow

So if it's gotta be you
Treat her nice
Hold her hand
And tell her twice
That she doesn't have to worry
And it will be alright
It's alright this time
It's alright this time

See her smiling at him?
That used to be me
I could find her in a thunderstorm
Just by the way that the rain would fall

There's a man wants to show me the river.
Hoofing at five I'll be more dead than alive.

Some wounds never heal

I don't want to grow old gracefully

be some old man in the road somewhere
Kneeling down in the dust by the side of the Interstate

I've been a rebel all my days

We were hopelessly outnumbered
It was a lost cause all along
But when we heard the bugles call
We swore we'd stand or fall together right or wrong

We ain't seen no reconstruction here
Just the scorched earth all around
And the high school band played ""Dixieland""
While they tore our tattered flags and banners down

I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days

Some dreams refuse to die

Asked me if she reminded me of you?

Said ""That's impossible to do.""

Happy and sad and back again

I think about you lying there,
and those blanket's lie so still.

Nothing breathes here in the cold,
Nothing moves or even smiles,
I've been thinking some of suicide,
but there's bars out here for miles.
Sorry about the every kiss;
Every kiss you wasted bad.

I'm gonna die alone and sad.

Remember the morning we dug up your gun
The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade

You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made""
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid
The cool desert morning and nothing to save
Just metal and plastic where your body caved
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade

You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin

[Instrumental]

Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face
Rising from a long night as dark as the grave
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith
On a morning to order a breakfast to make
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away

The winds have changed whisperin the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn

For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn

Because whe world is waiting
Waiting for one child

But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love, war to peace
And everyone to everyone’s neighbour
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever

You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue and Rosie you're the one
Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs `cause you know
we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business, I'm only here for fun

I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool skip some school act real cool Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright

Windows are for cheaters chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers winners use the door

And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you confiscate you I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Tell him this is last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me big advance

My tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
My machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Hold on tight stay up all night `cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'

Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun

Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark

So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys

He lived to put things in their place
He did a commendable job
He put himself so low he can hardly even look me in the face

But the last one I had was getting my hopes up
I might have been a little fast to dismiss
I think he let me down when he didn't disappoint me

Ridin' high grass of the switchback

A notice of eviction on the other hand

Into a station that got flooded when they opened up the dam
And broke their connections to the railway lines
So they could blast into the quarry,
And for every load of granite,
We got a ton of worry

One night at the diner over eggs,
Over easy she showed me the length of her legs,
But that gold plated cross on her neck, it was real
And you don't get that kind of money from pushing meal

Until we lost two pretty girls

Alderman and Caroline owned the house right up the hill
Where we laid those babies down
So they could still see our house

Suspicion got the best of old Alderman Haint
He owned an auto parts store off the interstate
But the lord took him home in July
And then Rose spilled the beans on the day that he died
and we was in trouble
I should've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, But I lied
Tied up to concrete at the bottom of the quarry
With a tattoo on his heart that spelled out ""Caroline""
He was silent but his rosary well it
Drifted into the custody
Of a sheriff that was just deputized

And I'm still here at the banquet hall

Bruce Springsteen,Rock,505.0,5.2,/bruce-springsteen/,After the thunder,/bruce-springsteen/after-the-thunder.html,"An echo fades of sounds once heard
By thousands brought together for
His ringing voice, a soul that stirred
The faithful to a mighty roar.

For twenty years upon the stage
For twenty years upon the stage
The passion deep within his soul
Brought forth the anger and the rage
His vision locked upon one goal.

The promises of rock and roll could
Break the chains upon his life,
Guitar in hand he vowed he would
Be free from pain and inner strife.

He shook the rafters in the halls
And brought the faithful to their feet,
His river coursed through mighty walls
Across this land, down every street.

With flag unfurled he took the word
Across the seas to hungry youth
Who raised their hands when e'er they heard
His cries for faith, and hope, and truth.

Today he stands with inner peace
A man content with home and health,
Upon his brow a jagged crease
A symbol of success and wealth.

The thunder of his younger days
Has passed, and now his words reveal
A calmer soul in many ways
Fulfilled with satisfactions real.

His arms upraised against the light
He stands alone, his eyes look toward
The ground below, a bird in flight
Still searching for his true reward.

His mission done, he finds retreat
With children and a loving wife,
His body tired from the heat
The price he pays for touring life.

But deep within the longings stir
The music runs within him still,
His passions for the times that were
Are stronger than his iron will.

And all of us who know the man
Will come together when he cries
The message we all understand
The thunder in us never dies.

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray.

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of God by name.

""Fear not, then,"" said the angel, ""Let nothing you afright
This day is born a Savior of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might.""

The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethl'em straightaway this blessed Babe to find.

But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this Infant lay,
They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray.

Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface.

God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign,
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again;
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--
That God send you a happy new year, happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.",en

And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some as the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
gives no indication for the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
pronouncing gross diversion as the label for the dog
oh it's the madness in his eyes as he breaks the night to cry

It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy from freecloud

And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crown
As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand
And the magic in the stare of the Wild Eyed Boy said
Stop, freecloud! They won't think to cut me down

But the cottages fell like the playing card hell
The tears on the face of a Wise Boy
Came trembling down to the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love

Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles

Turning blood red right before my eyes

A soul electrified
I feel a yearning within

The earth stands still as I shake
Before my maker's face

My body elevates
I see my world collide
I feel so alive
This might be my last

Walking on water in a raging storm
I could see the face of a man with a crown of thorns
In the distance I can hear a voice
And it's calling me, it's calling me

No need to justify

In the mountains and deltas
of VietnamIn '75 Saigon fell and he left his command
And brought his family to the promised land
Seabrook, Texas and the small towns in the Gulf of Mexico
It was delta country and reminded him of home
He worked as a machinist, put his money away
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin
And together they harvested Galveston Bay
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter
Steer out thru thechannel
And cast his nets into the water
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company
In the highlands of Quang Tri
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai
Shipped home in '68
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds
In a boat that'd been his father's
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son
And cast his nets into the water
Billy sat in front of his TV as the South fell
And the communists rolled into Saigon
He and his friends watched as the refugees came
Settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk
Of America for the Americans
Someone said 'You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out.'
And brought in the Texas Klan
One humid Texas night there were 3 shadows on the harbor
Come to burn the Vietnamese into the sea
In the fire's light shots rang out
2 Texans lay dead on the ground
Le stood with a pistol in his hand
A jury acquitted him in self-defense
As before the judge he did stand
But as Le walked down the courthouse steps
Billy said 'My friend you're a dead man.'
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside
Billy stood in the shadows
His K-bar knife in his hand
And the moon slipped behind the clouds
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket
Took a breath and let him pass
In the early darkness Billy rose up
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water
Kissed his sleeping wife
Headed into the channel
And cast his nets into the water
Of Galveston Bay

But one day the Eagle has to land

Out past the fountain

Then think -- well why not --
and stop for a coffee

things that you say

No one's at the door
You suggest a ghost
perhaps a phantom

I wanted a place to call my own.
And so I made the race, and staked me out a place,
And settled down along the Cimarron.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home, it blowed away.
It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there,
But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away.

I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.
Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
And got a fancy mortgage on the place.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
All the crops I planted blowed away.
You can't grow any grain if there isn't any rain;
All except the mortgage blowed away.

It blowed away my rooster and it blowed away my hens;
The pigs and cattle went astray.
All the crops that I sowed went a-foggin' down the road.
My Oklahoma farm, it blowed away.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
Everything I owned blowed away.
I hollered and I cussed when my land went up in dust,
When my Oklahoma farm, it blowed away.

It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there,
I figured I was all set for life.
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
And went to town and picked me out a wife.

She blowed away, she blowed away
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.
Just as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.

Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack;
So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed,
A-travelin' with the wind at my back.

I blowed away, I blowed away
Chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.
Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;
My Oklahoma farm is overhead.

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere.
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin'
I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.
But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,
My Oklahoma home that blowed away.

I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick 'til I die.
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;
My Oklahoma home is in the sky.

Turn the radio up loud,

I take her to the floor,
looking for a moment when the world seems right,
And I tear into the guts,
of something in the night.

You're born with nothing,
and better off that way,
Soon as you've got something the send
someone to try and take it away,
You can ride this road 'till dawn,
without another human being in sight,
Just kids wasted on
something in the night.

Nothing is forgotten or forgiven,
when it's your last time around,
I got stuff running around 'round my head
That I just can't live down

When we found the things we loved,
They were crushed and dying in the dirt.
We tried to pick up the pieces,
And get away without getting hurt,
But they caught us at the state line,
And burned our cars in one last fight,
And left us running burned and blind,
Chasing something in the night.

Alvina, spirit woman of the rings,
spirit woman from Kansas with a soul that sings.
Tell me baby baby, where you've been so long,
seen nothin' but trouble since you been gone.
Alvina with your master's eye around your neck,
looked everywhere baby, but I ain't seen you yet.
Heard you were in Africa, then again Spain
Heard you went to Texas and you brought the rain.

I remember you, down on the boulevard,
head held high, proud of your gypsie heart,
St. Cyr took you under her wings,
you grew up into a woman of the rings.

I still wear your bracelet upon my wrist,
I still carry the memory of your kiss,
can I see you one more time just to give it back?
For to give and to take is to surely be on the right track,
Alvina I'll give all my lovin' to you,
protect you 'till our lives are both over and through
I believed I talked to you last night in my dreams,
I felt you lay beside me, Lawd you were my gypsie queen.

I remember you, down on the boulevard,
head held high, proud of your gypsie heart,
St. Cyr took you under her wings,
you grew up into a woman of the rings.

In company all dressed in white
But meanwhile here at the world's dark end
The dragon draws the iron curtain round against the light
And souls grow weary in his war of love
and seek their solace strolling down the sweet civilian ways
But meanwhile back at the world's dark end
The nations see no future waiting for the serpent to strike
CHORUS: Where have all the Christian soldiers gone
Where is the resistance, will no-one be strong
When will we stand up tall and straight, rise up and storm the gate
How can we fail to get excited
The battle is ours, why don't we fight it
Battalions of darkness rise above me
But God put a fighter in me, put a fighter in me
So we will sing songs of victory
We will rise and set men free
We will applaud your majesty
We will proclaim your kingdom come
We will announce the battle done
We will lift up the righteous one
Listen and you're going to hear the sweetest sound you ever heard
It's the spirit blowing across the land
It's the voice of one who calls his bride to come and to be ready
Gentle as a dove he comes with fire

Past the all-night trauma stand

Castles made of laser lights
Take us to the shopping sector
In the vortex of the night
Past the shiny mylar towers
Past the ravaged tenements
To a place we can't remember
For a time we won't forget

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
What's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted out,
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners, saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Like there was something big pressing down on his back
So he called up his friends and they said come on out west
It's a place where a man can really feel his succes
So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf
Packed them next to the faith that he'd lost in himself
Said his good-byes and when the dirty work was done
He turned his wheels into the fading sun

For seven days and nights like a black-top bird he sped
Maintained radio silence 'cept for in his head
And just like his folks did back in '69
He crossed the border at Needles and heard the promised land on the line

Now where the Transcontinental dumps into the sea
There's a bar made up to look like 1963
Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone
As he brushed the desert dust off that Mercedes chrome
Bartender said ""Hey, how's it hangin', tiger?""
He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered ""lighter""

He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play
And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day
Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend
It could burn out every trace of where you been

There was a woman he'd met in a desert song
A little while later a son come along
Looked at that boy's smile and called it home
And that night as he lay in bed the only voice he heard was his own",en

The night was dark
The sky was blue
Down the alley the icewagon flew
Hit a bump somebody screamed
You shoulda heard just what I seen
Who do you love

Tombstone hand on a graveyard vine
Just 32 and I donâ€™t mind dyinâ€™
I rode a lion to town use a
rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene donâ€™t give me no lip
Arlene took me by the hand
She said oowee baby you know I understand
Arlene honey letâ€™s raise some sand
Be my woman Iâ€™ll be your man

As others were â€” I have not seen
As others saw â€” I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone.
Then â€” in my childhood â€” in the dawn
Of a most stormy life â€” was drawn
From ev'ry depth of good and ill
To mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that 'round me roll'd
In its autumn tint of gold â€”
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass'd me flying by â€”
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)

I say a prayer for your mama and daddy too

No lullabies for them

Will it ever end

You who done the deed better do some prayin' too
Better hope that God's forgivin' like they say
Cause somewhere, somebody keeps a list
Of the evils that men do
An' your name's right up there

Laughed at the words that you said,
I pushed the boat back to you,
I flew from the rain again,
Killed you with what I said,

You are the words I write
You are the ocean I will swallow
You are the wind I ride
You are the cause to keep my head up high
I will survive
You gotta know I'll stay beside you
Right till the day i die


I don't want to change anymore
I've already paid (said, I've already paid)
I don't have to pray anymore
Because my soul has been saved

And now,
Whenever I come, whenever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Never far away

You're the blood that's in my veins
You're my second skin skin
I'm a feather on the wind
You will bring me in
Every heart should have a beat
Every night a dream
Every king should have a queen
Every saint a sin

I don't want to change anymore (I don't want to change)
I've already paid (said I've already paid)
I don't have to pray anymore
Because my soul has been saved (been saved)

Whenever I come, whenever I go
No you're never far away, far away
Never far away

When I go hot you make sure I don't break
Gimme life inside of heavens gates, I know (heaven, heaven)
You taught me how to live like ****
Gave me definition for the worst I know
That there ain't no space between you and me

Whenever I come, whenever I go
No you're never far away, far away

Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so

The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so

Yeah! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
Well he talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
Well he walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man

Pleading with God
Please save me from from myself
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Please make me someone else
Your scarred
So wild
Way too cool to ask for help
Your affliction
Your addiction
Why can't you love yourself?

Under the surface
You're crying out for help
Outside is perfect
But you can't free yourself
From your beautiful cage
Your beautiful
So beautiful
From your beautiful cage
Your beautiful
So beautiful

If you could you would fly away
A butterfly with broken wings
I can see what's underneath
And I want to save you
Want to free you

Under the surface
You're crying out for help
Outside is perfect
But you can't free yourself
From your beautiful cage

I'd lie awake and listen to you gettin' ready for work,
the sound of your makeup case on the sink.
And the ladies at the office, all silk stockin's and rustlin' skirts.
And how proud and happy you always looked, walkin' home from work.

Well if Pa's eyes were windows, into a world so deadly and true,
you couldn't stop me from lookin', but you kept me from crawlin' through.
Well it's a funny old world Ma,
where a little boy's wishes come true.
Well I got a few in my pocket, and a special one just for you.

It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers, or a Mother's day card.
It ain't no house on the hill, with a garden and a nice little yard.
I got my hot rod down on Bond Street,
I'm older but you'll know me at a glance.
We'll find us a rock 'n roll bar, baby we'll go out and dance.

Well it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants,
gettin' up in the livin' room, to do the twist for my uncles and aunts.
Well I got a girl of my own now Ma,
yeah, we're doin' OK.
And I've been workin' up the nerve, to say what it is I got to say.

Last night we sat around laughin', at all those things that guitar brought
us,
and I laid awake thinkin' about the other things it's brought.

So I cycled 'cross the neighbourhood
Was invited by a skinny girl
Into her high class world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here
I'll have me a real good time

Dancing madly round the room, yeah
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune
Was escorted by a friendly slag
'Round the bedroom and back
Wandered across to the door
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead.

The skinny girl made it clear
That she only came here for the beer
The vicar simply reeked of gin
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle

Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
It's too easy to say
But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score

Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Takes me right back [when you were young]
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then [when you were young]

I don't care who's watching
Don't mind what the surfing heads might say
Although I may not be no Charlie Atlas
I'm gonna take my shirt off anyway

Now skin and bones sinks easy on the high tide
And I'm not one for castles in the sand

I think I spy a bottle in her hand
I think I spy a bottle in her hand

I don't need to know your birthday
A fortunteller I don't claim to be
There's a place I know of called the Tip Top
Won't you come and take a walk with me
Won't you come and take a walk with me

Melted like a chocolate in my arms

It never did the scenery no harm

Marianne Faithfull

The morning sun touched lightly on
the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In a white suburban bedroom
in a white suburban town

And she lay there neath the covers
dreaming of a thousand lovers
til the world turned to orange
and the room went spinning round

At the age of 37
she realized she'd never ride
through Paris in a sports car
with the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing
as she sat there softly singing
pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized
in her Daddy's easy chair

Her husband he's off to work
and the kids are off to school
and there were oh so many ways
for her to spend her days

She could clean the house for hours
or rearrange the flowers
or run naked through the shady street
screaming all the way

At the age of 37
she realized she'd never ride
through Paris in a sports car
with the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing
as she sat there softly singing
pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized
in her Daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on
the eyes of Lucy Jordan
on the rooftop where she climbed
when all the laughter grew too loud

And she bowed and curtsied to the man
who reached and offered her his hand
and he led her down to the long white car
that waited past the crowd

At the age of 37
she knew she'd found forever

but his basic soul was stained not pure
and when he took his bow
no audience was clapping

On which he feeds and yet tears him apart
And in this child so great that complication
Will surely destroy the strongest heart
And as you fall into the traps he sets you
And as you're drawn to cross his reckless line

On a window of a lane

Fall across your face
Your memory comes crashing down
Till all my bones break

A flower was made
And bury my face in your memory
Of all my mistakes

In the doorway of the streets
Where you used to stand
And kiss me goodbye
You would hold out your hand

It's starting to rain
On Broadway and Canal
While the radiator rumbles
And the rain's coming down

I don't wanna let go
Take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning
To walk in the dark

Your fingers still slide
From my wrist to my hand
On our way to the station
In the rain while the traffic's all jammed

Now there's nothing to say
Not even ""goodnight""
I just scribble your name in tears
In the book of my life

You will always be saved
Some place behind my eyes
Where it's always summer
And we laugh in the summertime

When nothing is moving.
Least of all me.
I lay on my back in the hay.
The warm sun was soothing.
It made me feel good.
The day I met Marie.

The sound of her whisper hello.
Came tiptoing softly into my head.
I opened my eyes kinda slow.
And there she was smiling.
It made me feel good.
The day I met Marie.

With the laughing eyes.
She'd toss her hair and tantalize.
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze.

I remember her kiss
So soft on my brow
And the way that she said
Baby go to sleep now
Baby go to sleep now

I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from
But I still feel good
To think i've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize

Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights

For the days of fate were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold.

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies

But we can't stop trying 'till we break up our minds

In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting
Through the pouring rain

For an unfamiliar song
And she's pictures all the places
Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
""Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly


In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

hey, how about that
Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality
well, more and more people know all about it

Do you remember that song by a dude named Bobby Fuller
It went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

We sat around the other night, me and the guys
trying to find the right word
That would best fit and describe
you people like that
That no principle has touched, no principle's baptized
how about that
They'd eat shit and say it tasted good
if there was some money in it for them

Hey, you remember that song about this guy from Texas
Whose name was --- Bobby Fuller

There's nothing that I want, nothin' that you need say
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way

I was no more than a kid when you put me on the Southern Queen
With the police on my back I fled to New Orleans
Well I fought in the dockyards for the the money that I made
I knew the fight was my home and the blood was my trade
Baton Rouge, Ponchatoula, and Lafayette town
They payed me their money, ma, I knocked the man down
Well I did what I did, yeah it come easily
Restraint and mercy were always strangers to me

I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud
Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood
In the twelfth, I slipped my tounge over my broken jaw
I stood over him and I pounded his bloody body into the floor
Well the bell rang and rang and still I kept on
'Til I felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone

Then the women and the money came fast and the days I lost track
The women red, the money green, but the numbers were black
I fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets
Well I took my good share, ma, I have no regrets

I took the fix at the state armory with Big John McDowell
From high in the rafters I watched myself fall
As they raised his arm my stomach twisted and the sky it went black
I stuffed my bag with their good money and I never looked back

Understand, in the end, Ma, every man plays the game
If you know me one different then speak out his name
Ma, if my voice now you don't recognize
Then just open the door and look into your dark eyes
I ask of you nothin', not a kiss not a smile,
Just open the door and let me lie down for a while

Now the gray rain's fallin' and my ring fightin's done
So in the work fields and alleys I take all who'll come
If you're a better man than me then just step to the line
Show me your money and speak out your crime
Now there's nothin' I want, Ma, nothin' that you need say
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way

And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing ""we shall overcome""

Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

Do you remember

September lives in flames.
My youth lies bruised and broken

We're having a party
We're burning it down
We're building an idol
He's sad but he don't frown
He's the cream of the crop
So we're making him god
Start writing this down
When I give you the nod

Them Coptic monks
Knew how to keep it real
That Rosicrucian thing
That Zoroastrian deal
Well, they might be wrong
They don't give a damn
Long as they don't run out
Of sacrificial lambs

Eat my dust
And I'll clean your clock
Eat my dust
And we'll reel and rock
Eat my dust
And I'll be your man
You can be my
Sacrificial lamb

Madame Blavansky
And her friends
Changed lead into gold
And back again
Krishnamurti said,
""I'll set you free
Write a check
and make it out to me""

Take a look
At my family tree
Every brother and sister
Wants something for free
You get what pay for
From me, my friend
Nothing for nothing
Forever, amen

Eat my dust
You can touch my stole
Eat my dust
And we'll rock and roll
Eat my dust
And I'll be your man
You can be my
Sacrificial lamb

Smokey and the Bandit
And Saddam Hussein
Were staying up late
And acting insane
Along with Russell Crowe
And Hafez Assad
Start taking this down
When I give you the nod

The boys are all ready
They've laid out the plans
They're setting the stage
For the man-made man
We've worked out the kinks
In your DNA
So sayonara, kid
Have a nice day

Eat my dust
And I'll clean your clock
Eat my dust
And we'll reel and rock
Eat my dust
And I'll be your man
You can be my
Sacrificial lamb

Runs into a wall

Gorged like a lion on experience

and gold being made from lead

The same power that burned Hiroshima
causing three legged babies and death
Shrunk to the size of a nickel
to help him regain his breath

Down by the river we made plans
Of what would and would not be
It was impossible to see

Their black boots shone in the sun
They were waiting on the Annandale train
when my baby come
Little girl with the long black hair
Do you know what lies 'neath the long coats that they wear

Once I swore you'd ride with me
(to some far and distant shore)
Down where this river meets the sea
(I'll make you mine forevermore)
Over these dark hills I'd walk along
(just to hold you in my arms)
To lie with you on a bed of stone

River blood red with the years
You can flood this valley with a thousand tears
Wash away all that's been found
But you'll never wash away the sound

Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down

Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf

This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her

This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more

And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time

This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself

This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

She believed in the birth of the broad sword

As a child I dreamed of her, on the far banks of the river
I knew she could not be reached, for my mind was forever wondering
Far above his head, as he tried his best to teach me
The river was muddy and black, black as the coal she carried
Impossible to cross, many men had tried
The old sailor told me, another life is lost

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Black was the colour of my childish dreams, impressions that would last
Black coal, coal black pit yacka's face, escaping the coal dust blast
Blind pony stumblin' to the light of day, to retire in the green fields forever
And I'll build me a bridge of steel, to beat the black river forever
I'll beat that black river forever, I'll beat that muddy river forever

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

When he came upon this Earth he brought his family joy.
A paranoid young brave was he, inside his frame was some misery,
He heard the other warriors talking angrily 'bout the white man taking over his country.


CHORUS
What he didn't know, is that some day his ma would be crying.
What he didn't know, is that some day his tribe would be dying.
What he didn't know, is that some day his father'd be gone.
What he didn't know, is that some day he'd be all alone.


None of the stories in the schoolbooks said it, the truth is gone and they're tryin' to forget it.
The history books are all one-sided, the truth is gone and their trying to hide it.
Who had the land 'till we came around? The Indian made his life from the ground.
And what about the boy that this story's about? Where his tee-pee once stood there now is a town.

Your poisoned soul displayed
Seen each move you've made
Contaminate, degrade

Knocking down
Stamp your tiny foot

Cause your heart to feel joy

That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight
Is it the cry of the river
With the moonlight shining through

But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head
And God's light came shinin' on through
I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew

It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true
It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms

Like dark geese into the Oklahoma skies

This is a prayer for the souls of the departed

Young lives over before they got started

All I can think of is what if it would've been him instead
I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down

Where you get paid and your silence passes as honor
And all the hatred and dirty little lies
Been written off the books and into decent men's eyes

Your landlord straightened his hat

Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows
Of night, here with you in my arms.

This is the moment that pauses to hold us
As you and I move in a background of wonder,
Surrounded by countless enclosures
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.

Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,
You see how I need you, come down.

And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us
And nestled against us â€”

You're here â€”
And warm.

And mine till the time
When the dawn will awake you,
The morning will shake you,
The highway will take you.

But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights
We count on the night to hold everything even,
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,
And destiny's folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.

But now as the gardens of softening night time
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,
You and I come together
And walk through the dreams of the stars.

So here while the song of the deepening evening
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow
And know where we've been.

the bell tolls
the black plague has struck
diseased eyes roll upwards
as if knowing which direction their souls will travel
(bring out your dead)
a woman in black cries
as the deathly procession passes by
and monks moan en masse

ohohohohohoh
(gregorian chants)

the yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door
for it is safer inside the walls
their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard
the bodies of unfortuates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls
and ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches.
(bring out your dead)
and the bell tolls on

a man walks around the castle walls on the outside
the light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves
he tends the sick
gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
but he feels it most for the children
(unclean)
tears glisten on his cheek
did man ever deserve this death?
and not all will die, just the poor
for the rich are inside the castle walls
and he knows he could be with them
and they laugh at this fool of a man
through the stone fortress windows
and the bell tolls on

(unclean)
and many deaths and many days later
many tears have been cry cried but in vain
for tears can never erase the pain of death
only time has that talent
his hands are now blistered but this man walks on
the only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
and the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
(bring out your dead)

the dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
life for the people flowers again
they breathe fresh air like they did once before
and there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
the bell has stopped
and only silence is heard
and the peasants outside wonder what happened within
in their bones they feel something is wrong
the bell has been silent much too long
for many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
no one came and no one went
fear can do many strange things
and even though water ran low
their mouths burnt and bellys caked dry
not one person put a foot outside
no one had that much courage
for they feared the peasants and their world outside
so they played it safe and didn't move
but one by one they perished and died

And the last big town we came to was San Francisco.
Life, there, was fine, only Anna felt so tired
And grew envious of others:
Of those who pass the time at their ease and in comfort;
Those too proud to be bought,
Of those whose wrath is kindled by injustice,
Those who act upon their impulses happily,
Lovers true to their loved ones,
And those who take what they need without shame;
Whereupon I told my poor tired sister,
When I saw how much she envied them:

""Sister, from birth we may write our own story,
And anything we choose we are permitted to do,
But the proud and insolent who strut in their glory â€”
Little they guess, little they guess,
Little they guess the fate they're swaggering to.

Sister, be strong! You must learn to say no to
The joys of this world, for this world is a snare;
Only the fools of this world will let you go,
Who don't care a damn, don't care a damn,
Don't care a damn, will be made to care.

Don't let the flesh and its longings get you.
Remember the price that a lover must pay,
And say to yourself when temptations beset you â€”
What is the use ? What is the use ?
Beauty will perish and youth pass away.

Sister, you know, when our life here is over,
Those who were good to go to bliss unalloyed,
Those who were bad are rejected forever,
Gnashing their teeth, gnashing their teeth,
Gnashing their teeth in a gibbering void.""

With my memories for a pillow

Yelling out a warning to some passer by

Diving down with everything to win

Ever does come in

Like falling from the sun
Come and knock me over

A tree or a piece of steel I could do

I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush

kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
kill them whenever you can

When I was just about settled
And when it counts you recoil
With a cryptic word and leave a love belittled

Good time can put me in fear
Always feel safe when things are bad
So I cannot let you come near
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you have come and bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch my life go by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyone surprises me
Wishing it was

This feeling won’t last cause I cannot survive
I tell you I’ve been here before
When it’s movin this fast
It's a matter of time
One of us walks out that door
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you come and you bring out the tears in me

Give this some thought
And I’m sure you will know
This is the way it must be
Emotions will rise, emotions will flow
You bring out the tears in me

It's so strange to watch your life walk and where everyday
I've been burning the candle at both ends
And lied the truth I can’t pretend
This is why I will not stay baby
Just like that I’m on my way

What shall we do with the dreames
Who see a world we can never know
Who have found a place of wonder
Where only children dare to go

What shall we do with the dreames
Whose world has no room for hate
Whose vision of tomorrowæŠ¯ promise
Is so far removed from our fate

For they dream of a thousand tomorrows
Each one better than the one before
A future filled with compassion
For the tired, the weak, the hungry and the poor

What shall we do with the dreamers
Who no longer answer when we ask why
Who work to make their world better
And are unefraid to try
What whall we say to the dreamers
Whose lives make ours seem so bare
Who make us feel so empty
Because they dare to care
For they dream not of thing done before
But of the miracles which lie ahaid
Of the needy who can be assisted
And the famshed who can be fed

What shall we make of the dreamers
When they choose not to live as we
When they say our world has no meaning
As long as others are still not free
What shall we think of the dreamers
When they no longer listen to what we say
When their silence leaves us uneasy
And they refuse to go away

For they dream of fanciful figures
Poised in mid-flight
Angels with Wings of Grace
Floating on the light
Messengers from the next world
So unfamiliar but yet not strange
Bringing word of the New World
The begginnin of the change

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine,
What rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse
The joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse
The chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire
Remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire
I only remember
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

Into a baby's sun,
We rolled down into the town
From where the Black Throats come.

There was a holdup.
Ooh, there was a shootout.
And there was a killin'.
And there's blood on my hands.
Today I killed a man.

Well, she had an appetite for lovin'
Only a fadin' beauty could posses.
She knew just what she wanted
And she wouldn't take less.

I figured it was a small town.
It was at sundown.
It was just a small crowd of people around.

No, he wouldn't put his guns down.

And showed me the story of the self-loading pistol.

Well now, father. I have come.
To tell you about somethin' I done.
He had a widow, runnin' through town screamin'.
He had a brother, and his tears were streamin'.
Now I'm movin' on the border
With a rifle on my shoulder.

And showed me the glory of the self-loading pistol.

They put blood in his coffee

There was war in his body
and it caused his brain to holler

Make the sacrifice
mutilate my face
If you need someone to kill
I'm a man without a will
Wash the razor in the rain
let me luxuriate in pain
Please don't set me free
death means a lot to me

The pain was lean and it made him scream
he knew he was alive
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest
he thought he was a saint
I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother
what am I to do
When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car
it cannot be controlled

Spit upon his face and scream
there's no Oedipus today
This is no play you're thinking you are in
what will you say
Take the blue mask down from my face
and look me in the eye
I get a thrill from punishment
I've always been that way

I loathe and despise repentance
you are permanently stained
Your weakness buys indifference
and indiscretion in the streets
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
you deserve to be soundly beat

Make the sacrifice

A diamond crucifix in his ear
is used to help ward off the fear
that he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
to clean the mess that he has dropped
into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell

And Romeo wanted Juliette

his shoulders and curses Jesus
runs a comb through his black pony-tail

the sink that by his bed gives off a stink
then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell

Outside the street were steaming the crack
dealers were dreaming
of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
with my one good arm behind my back

Brother give me another tote
those downtown hoods are no damn good
those Italians need a lesson to be taught

with Latin written on it that says
""it's hard to give a shit these days""

holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute

Two hearts are better than one

Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes
But I was living in a world of childish dreams
Someday these childish dreams must end
To become a man and grow up to dream again
Now I believe in the end

Two hearts are better than one...

Sometimes it might seem like it was planned
For you to roam empty hearted through this land
Though the world turns you hard and cold
There's one thing mister that I know
That's if you think your heart is stone
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind
That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one

Two hearts are better than one...

Dropped two aces, smiled,
And threw my cards back

Surrounds himself with worldly things

I was looking for something to do
Nothing I found could ever quite occupy me
With nothing to gain there's always nothing to lose

Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs
Cry me a river till the morning comes

I should've died a hundred thousand times
Teetering stoned off the side of buildings
Nobody loved me and nobody even tried
You can't hang on to something that wont stop moving

I spit in his face, the bastard knocked me out
He leered at my lady and then he touched her face
Thank God she had the money to bail me out

Go on put it to me shake it till the rattles come on
Take me where the morning don't come

Until one day he wandered off and died
One night I went in the yard and dug him up
And he laid in the box just like a pile of bones

Coming behind me and following close as they could
Eventually they'd just trail off

Bar room boogie just like in the movies
Go on put it to me shake it till the rattles come on

Mixing liquor with mystery pills
Mystery pills and heroin mixed into cocaine
Face down out on the riverside
Most of my friends are married and making them babies
To most of them I already died
And whatever it is about you I've always hated
Is something about myself I just couldn't hide

And I'm going going baby I'm gone

I can't let my tomorrows decide
What I am in this life

It's no secret
I can't pretend, I can't forget
What I've done
Every day I live with the consequences
I let it beat me, let it keep me, let it throw me to the floor
Those days are over
I'm moving forward
It can't hurt me

And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day

I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get ?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I can hear him coughing all night long
About a hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song.

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They just tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song.

Well you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing near the window where the light is strong
Oh they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song.

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never , we'll never have to lose it again.

Well I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track

Standing, like to seem casual
With a resemblance to people held by fear.
Lit by fire and disrepair.

Only stories reach this far.
No one's left and no one's coming
And I will disappear
Far away from you,

And the blue millionaire.

Blue as the dusk that ended my day
And shut off the light and air.

Found you where you slept.
Got me down with something else than bruises

Tied me to a blue chair
Lit by fire and disrepair

Seen him drinking gin from pale blue bottles,
Drowning in shadow,
Shadows moving in.
Forever imagine
Imagine it's him
Nearby the window
With dreams broken in.

I don't laugh anymore â€” or smile,
I am lost in the body,
The passion of time.
He is screening my dreams
And everything that's mine.
Don't stay in this mirror
Other hands have left me in.
You don't blow away as I do.
It will be the same again.
Turn and point away from here.
Steal what you cannot win

was the egg cream served at Becky's, it was a fearsome brew
For 50 cents you got a shot, choco bubbles up your nose
that made it easier to deal with knife fights
and kids pissing in the street

You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream

So the next time you're in Brooklyn, please say hello for me
at Totonno's for Pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's
But mostly you go to Becky's, sit in a booth and say hello
and have two chocolate egg cream, one to stay and one to go

You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream, ah
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream

I'll turn the camera on
And I won't even be there
a portrait that moves, you look great I think

I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall
for 24 hours glowing on your wall
Watch the sun rise above it in your room
wallpaper art, a great view

I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art
it's the same one you can buy at any supermarket
'Cause I've got the style it takes
and you've got the people it takes

This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground
I show movies on them, do you like their sound
'Cause they have a style that grates
and I have art to make

Let's do a movie here next week

With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills
Man came by to hook up my cable TV
We settled in for the night my baby and me
We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn
There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on

Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish
So I hopped into town for a satellite dish
I tied it to the top of my Japanese car
I came home and I pointed it out into the stars
A message came back from the great beyond
There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on

Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires
We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs
All I got was a note that said ""Bye-bye John
Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on""

So I bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast
And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast
'Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet
And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace

If you don't have a point to make,
Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind,
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed
Why should I follow that beacon/beepin' (?)
That I'm better than fine

'cross the San Bernardino line
Where the truckers and the bikers
gather every night at the same time
At seven the band comes in and locals dance the night away
At Sleepy Joe's Café

I drive on down from the big town Friday
when the clock strikes five
As the red sun sets in the ocean, I start to come alive
Summer girls in the parking lot slap on their makeup
and they flirt the night away
Sleepy Joe's Café

Joe came home in '45 and took out a G. I. loan
On a sleepy little spot an Army cook could call his own
He married May, the highway come in
and they woke up to find
They were sitting on top of a pretty little gold mine

Saturday night the lights are bright
as the folks pour in from town
Joe keeps the blues playin', at the bar May
lays the beers down
I come through the door and feel the workweek slip away
See you out on the floor
and Monday morning's a million miles away

You come for me, you come and try to take me home
I'm always in need, and it's hard to be reciprocating
The fabric of our life gets torn

With everything changin', so how am I to know?
How I want to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of
control
You and I together, but only one of us in love
And everybody knows

He says a name, it echoes in my head like it was a
canyon
He says a name, he says it and I know what's up
You come to me sometimes when I'm thinking like a
cannonball shooting out of cannons
And I forget whatever it was I was thinking about

His blankets are made out of cardboard,
And his pillows are made out of stone
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie

See the man walking on the water, see the light in his eyes
He came into the world with a message to tell,
He came into the world to die
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie

You're always telling stories, you're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?
So think of yourself in the water, seeing your days flashing by
It's too late to see what you wanted to be,
You've spent all your time, you must die

Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie, oh

You're always telling stories, you're always telling me lies
